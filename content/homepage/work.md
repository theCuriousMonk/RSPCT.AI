AI is transforming our world, and the people who use it are driving that transformation. From developers to data scientists, from artists to entrepreneurs, the AI Skills and Accomplishments Awards recognize the outstanding work being done by people who are using AI to solve problems, create new products, and push the boundaries of what's possible.

Whether you're an experienced professional or just starting out, if you're using AI to make a difference, we want to hear from you. Our awards program is open to individuals of all ages and backgrounds, from all corners of the globe. We welcome entries from those who have made significant contributions to the field, as well as those who are just starting out and making their mark.
